### Welcome!
I am a fifth-year PhD student in computer science major at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
supervised by Prof. Tarek Abdelzaher. My research interests lie in Internet of Things (IoT), deep learning and
mobile computing. My current research topics include generative models for IoT, neural network robustness,
foundation models for IoT, and deep learning in the frequency domain. I expect to graduate in July 2024.

### About me

I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942.
After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs.
After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now the California Institute of Technology.
